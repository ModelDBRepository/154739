This is the readme for the models and methods associated with the paper:

Visser S, Van Gils SA (2014) Lumping Izhikevich neurons EPJ Nonlinear
Biomedical Physics 25(12):6

These files were contributed by Sid Visser.

The files Urd01.m and Urd02.m in the top level folder reproduce
figures from the paper. The Norns folder contain a universal
simulation environment and documentation for Norns, designed and
developed by Sid Visser.

Windows users will need to compile the c++ files in
Norns\VerdandiLite1_1\VerdandiLite_CPP using the makefile. This is
only necessary for the first time.
